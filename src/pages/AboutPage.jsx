My journey has woven through various rewarding paths – as a musician, a teacher, a REALTOR, and a small business owner. Each of these roles has fueled my inspired, creative, and driven approach to everything I do, especially when it comes to photography.

At the heart of Mind's Eye Photography: Where Moments Meet Imagination is my dedication to you. While I cherish the fulfillment of capturing moments that spark my own imagination, my true passion lies in doing the same for my clients. Based in Madison, I frequently travel across the state, always on the lookout for that next inspiring scene.

For me, client satisfaction isn't just a goal – it's the foundation of every interaction. I pour my energy into ensuring you not only love your photos but also enjoy the entire experience. It's truly rewarding to see clients transform into lifelong friends, and that's the kind of connection I strive to build with everyone I work with.
